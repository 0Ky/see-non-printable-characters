# View non-printable Unicode Characters

This is a very little PHP scipt to recognize and display unicode characters that are otherwise invisible.

The tool received some attention on [soscisurvey.de](https://www.soscisurvey.de/tools/view-chars.php), so we chose to make the source public here on GitHub.
